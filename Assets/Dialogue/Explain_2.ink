You're back! I hope your little break was nice.
Now that the shop is open, its time to start serving customers!
Orders come out pretty fast, and our chefs *literally* toss items out as they finish!
You'll have to catch them as they come out, using the MOUSE to guide your platter towards all those tasty morsels.
I know you'll be able to do it. Good luck!
