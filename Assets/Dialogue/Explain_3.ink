Hello again! Its been a great day with you around.
Now that the shop is closing up for the day, we could use your help with picking everything up.
You can just use your MOUSE to drag items into their appropriate bins. For a cafe-master like you, this should practically be child's play!
Don't forget, RED is for trash, BLUE is for recycle and GREEN is for compost.
Thanks again for all your hard work! I'll see you again tomorrow.
