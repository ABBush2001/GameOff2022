You're here! I'm so glad you could make it.
Welcome to your first day at the Early Bird cafe! 
There's always lots to do, but for now why don't you start by stocking the counters with pastries?
Its pretty simple, just use your MOUSE to drop items into their appropriate windows based on the signs in front of them.
I'm sure you'll do great. Good luck with your first day!
